      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Donovan West, a 20-year-old photographer from St. Louis and a sophomore at Central Methodist University. I play both basketball and soccer, and I’ve always had a passion for staying active and pushing myself to grow.
Photography has been something I’ve loved for a long time. What started as just taking pictures for fun turned into something much bigger. I enjoy capturing real moments and creating images that people can look back on for years.
Whether I’m working with individuals, brands, or creative projects, my goal is simple — to create timeless, high-quality photos that feel real and meaningful. I’m always learning, improving, and putting my heart into every shot.

          <h3>My Approach</h3>
          <p>
            My work focuses on clean composition, natural emotion, and elevated editing.
            Whether we’re shooting portraits, lifestyle, or brand content, the goal is always
            the same: photographs that feel honest and cinematic.
